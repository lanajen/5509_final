    1. Description of the supervised learning problem
    2. Exploratory Data Analysis
    3. Model analysis: building and training the model
    4. Results
    5. Discussion and conclusion

My project aims to provide insight on the realities of crime statistics.

The supervised learning aspect focuses on using patterns in the dataset to build a model that anyone can use to stay more informed. The most successful model in my project is one that sheds light on crime at different altitudes/elevations. All models use the multi regression method.
